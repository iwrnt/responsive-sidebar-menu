# Responsive Sidebar Menu

Hi! This is a simple project about responsive sidebar menu. I created this project to let me learn more about `css`.

This project is inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFvfqUMjvsA).

> The logo that I used is created by [Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/letter-i).
